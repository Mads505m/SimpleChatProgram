## Overview

The `entity` directory contains the domain entities and business models of the application. These are the core classes that represent the main objects and their behaviors.

## Contents

- **Domain Models**: Classes that represent key business objects (e.g., `Message`, `User`).
- **Entities**: Core business entities that may also be mapped to database tables.

## Guidelines

- **Domain-Centric**: Focus on defining the core business logic and entities.
- **Encapsulation**: Keep entity classes focused on representing business data and behaviors.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for entities to ensure they correctly encapsulate business logic.
