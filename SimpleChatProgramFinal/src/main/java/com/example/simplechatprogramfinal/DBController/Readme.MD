# com.example.chatprogramassignment.DBController

## Overview

The `dbcontroller` directory is responsible for managing database interactions and data persistence. This includes defining how data is accessed, manipulated, and stored in the database.

## Contents

- **Repositories**: Interfaces for CRUD operations on domain entities.
- **Data Access Objects (DAOs)**: Classes that encapsulate database access logic.
- **Configuration**: Database connection and configuration settings.

## Guidelines

- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure that database logic is separated from business logic.
- **Consistency**: Follow naming conventions and maintain consistency in repository interfaces.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for data access components to ensure reliability.
